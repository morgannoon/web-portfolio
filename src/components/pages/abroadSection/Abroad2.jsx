                        I’ve been dancing for 16 years traveling all
                        over North America and Ireland competing on the regional, national,
                        and world stage. I never got to enjoy the culture of Ireland outside of dance.

                        My grandfather was born in Armagh, Ireland so by descent
                        I’m an Irish citizen! I’m getting my Irish passport this year!

                        After taking an Irish culture class, my professor said she was
                        reopening her study abroad program and as someone who always dreamed of
                        studying abroad since high school I jumped at the chance.
