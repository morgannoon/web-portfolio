                                Started my trip with a guided walking tour through Dublin’s historic streets,
                                followed by a visit to the iconic Guinness Storehouse and learned how to properly taste beer.

                                I learned about the history of croke park stadium and its impact of reviving irish culture
                                and how the land was given to gaa to jump start it and then paid back the guy who lended it.
                                I also learned about Bloody Sunday which happened in the stadium in response to the executions
                                that happened earlier that day.

                                At Henrietta Street, I learned about the overcrowded, harsh living conditions. Kilmainham Gaol was moving, especially Plunket’s story of marrying before his execution. The Book of Kells amazed me with its intricate designs and colors, along with the tale of its theft by Vikings.</p>

                                On the walking tour, I heard a ghost story about the British-Spanish battle in Galway that damaged the Spanish Arch, and later visited O’Connell’s, where Galway Girl was filmed, enjoying pizza and rock music.

                                Gaelic football was amazing to watch, especially seeing the new rule in action and the energy build in a close finish. Later, sparching at the Spanish Arch with the locals, drinking by the water and watching the sunset at high tide, was the perfect way to end the day.

                                the uillean pipe that solo made me tear up.
                                I got to see some world champs that I’ve seen dance at competitions
                                which was cool and it was cool to see a whole family involved in the production.

                                Connemara was beautiful, a largely Gaelic-speaking and farming area. At Kilmore Abbey, the nuns tend stunning gardens, grow their own food, and even make chocolate. I also got to feed sheep and learn the meaning of their markings.

                                I also got to see the cliffs from a a boat which was so different than up top. I learned
                                that part of the princess bride was filmed there which is one of my favorite classic movies.

                    <text>
                        My two-week study abroad in Ireland was an unforgettable experience. I loved exploring new places, learning about the country’s rich culture, and even getting the chance to share a bit of my Irish dancing. Each day brought opportunities to meet new people and form connections, making the trip even more meaningful.
                        My only “assignment” was to jot down three bullet points summarizing each day, which gave me the freedom to fully enjoy the experience while still reflecting on everything I was learning and doing.
